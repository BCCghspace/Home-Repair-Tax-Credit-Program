## Motivation
1. One paragraph on the motivation for the analysis.
```{r uptake rate figure, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}

ggplot(mutate(housingsubsidy, tookSubsidy = fct_infreq(tookSubsidy))) + geom_bar(aes(x = tookSubsidy)) +

  plotTheme()
```


## Data visualizations
2. Develop and interpret data visualizations that describe feature importance/correlation.

## Data wrangling

## Add new features
4. Engineer new features that significantly increase the Sensitivity.

a.Interpret your new features in one paragraph.

b.Show a regression summary for both the kitchen sink and your engineered regression. 

c.Cross validate both models; compare and interpret two facetted plots of ROC, Sensitivity and Specificity.

## Cost benefit analysis
6a.Write out the cost/benefit equation for each confusion metric.
6b Create the 'Cost/Benefit Table' as seen above.

If we predict that a household will take the credit, then HCD is willing to allocate $2,850 per homeowner which includes staff and resources to facilitate mailers, phone calls, and information/counseling sessions at the HCD offices. Given the new targeting algorithm, we should now assume 25% of contacted eligible homeowners take the credit. The remainder receive the marketing allocation but do not take the credit.

The credit costs $5,000 per homeowner which can be used toward home improvement. Academic researchers in Philadelphia evaluated the program finding that houses that transacted after taking the credit, sold with a $10,000 premium, on average. Homes surrounding the repaired home see an aggregate premium of $56,000, on average. 

1. 10000 premium per house that accepts subsidy
2. 2850 in marketing for each house
3. 5000 subsidy per house that accepts
4. 25% of contacted homeowners take subsidy
